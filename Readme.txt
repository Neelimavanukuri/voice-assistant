# 🎙 Voice-Based Virtual Assistant for Windows

## 🚀 Overview
This **Voice-Based Virtual Assistant** allows users to control their **Windows system** using **voice commands**, enhancing accessibility and productivity. The assistant can **open applications, perform web searches, manage files, set reminders, and automate system tasks** like restarting or shutting down—all through **Speech Recognition and AI-driven automation**.

## 🔍 Features
✅ **Speech-to-Text (STT)** – Converts voice commands into text.  
✅ **Voice-Controlled App Launching** – Open Notepad, Chrome, File Explorer, etc.  
✅ **Web Search Automation** – Perform searches on Google, Wikipedia, and other platforms.  
✅ **File Management** – Open, rename, delete, and search files.  
✅ **Reminders & Notes** – Set up reminders and take notes using voice input.  
✅ **System Commands** – Restart, shut down, or log off the system.  
✅ **Multi-Language Support** – Recognizes commands in multiple languages.  
✅ **Error Handling & Feedback** – Real-time responses to invalid commands.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Speech Recognition:** Google Speech API, CMU Sphinx
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** pyttsx3, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- **Automation & System Control:** Windows Speech API, OS Module
- **Web Scraping & Search:** Wikipedia API, Selenium
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK (for advanced command recognition, optional)

## 🔬 How It Works
1️⃣ **User speaks a command** (e.g., *"Open Notepad"*, *"Search for AI on Wikipedia"*, *"Shutdown computer"*).  
2️⃣ **Speech-to-Text Processing** – Uses **Google Speech API** to process voice input.  
3️⃣ **Command Execution** – Maps recognized text to predefined system actions using Python automation.  
4️⃣ **Response & Feedback** – Provides voice or system-generated responses via **Text-to-Speech synthesis (TTS)**.
